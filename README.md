# My Projects to better understand Data Analytics & Machine Learning.

* AudioWordScrapper
  - Scapes audio files based off a keyword from Forvo.
* Hands-On ML
  - Practice lessons from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow.
* MyAnalyticSolver
  - A graphic user interface that loads a .CSV file and computes a regression/classification algorithm from scikit-learn. 
  - Pending completion: In the process of better understanding ML before implementing it to the assigned variables.
* Resources
  - Great references for training/visualizing audio data
* Rover
  - Web controlled rover with camera and sonar sensors. Objective: To teach it reinforcement learning & simple object detections.
* Train Audio Files
  - Python script that converts .wav and .mp3 to .wav audio file with 44,100 sample rate. Python script that records audio.
* Wake Word Ethan
  - Extension of Deep Learning course assignment (https://github.com/bdthai81/DeepLearning-Coursera-Assignments/tree/master/C5W3-Trigger%20word%20detection)
  - Goal: To make an wake word off "Ethan" instead of "Activation"
  - Made modifications on the training audio sample from 10s to 4s.
  - Pending completion: In the process of learning how to gather better training data. (Resources above)
